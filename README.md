# EC601A1-Kaggle-IPF-group09
This project will use image processing and machine learning systems to assist in devloping a prognosis for Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF). This was inspired by the Kaggle competiton, "OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis Progression" (
## Sprint 1
### Product Mission
Our goal is to create an architecture that analyzes the CT scans (DICOM images) of the lungs and other metadata which will be used by physician/radiologist to reach a prognosis on the state of the patient's lung tissue.
The User will ideally interface with an app or webpage that will ask to upload an image and fill out medical data. 
### MVP and MVP User Stories 
"As a patient I would like an easy to read and understandable score."
"As a physician I want medically relevent information."
"As a user I want a simple UI."
"As a user I wan a quick "real-time" result."
"As a physician I want an uncertainty of the prediction."
### Technolgies to Evaluate
In the front end, the team has decided to interface with the user with a webpage rather than an app. Back end technogloy and architecture is still being analyzes and will deduced in sprint 2. 
### Development Environment 
For our project we will be expanding upon the ML algorithims in the Kaggle notebooks. Additonally, we will utilze Github for libraries and other sources.
